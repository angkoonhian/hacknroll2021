### ChatWithSamuel Project


As a student, whenever a friend sends their notes to a group or simply just reading some articles to prepare for exams, do you ever feel stressed over the huge chunks of words and endless pages? Now what if I told you that I have a solution for you? Huge long chunks of text in files can be summarised to clean and clear cut paragraphs for our learning and allowing us to allocate our time more efficiently. Our group has decided to take on ChatWithSamuel chat room project to not only chat with our friends but also gain greater efficiency while texting. 


### Features: ChatRoom And Deep Learning Summarizer

Currently, our application has several open chat rooms, where users can join in the group chat. What can we do in the chatroom? How is this different from those chat rooms already widely used in the market? 

Apart from catching up with families and friends in the chatroom, users can also enjoy greater efficiency when using our chatroom. What do we mean by greater efficiency? When users want to send a file, the app can do an extractive summary so users can send a short summary rather than long text files to other users. Our automated deep learning summarizer user NLP is able to extract text from pdf, word, text and even png files and summarize them into short and clean paragraphs for users to read.
